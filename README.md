Business Path
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The focus of this app is to centralize on user-friendliness. To often apps as such do not create an environment that does not allow the user to freely use the app, but restrict the user to specifications that are not always practical. The app is naturally inviting to busy users. As such, busy users tend to be professionalist, but not limiting too. Based off that statistic, the app should feel comfortable for both, personal use, and a professional use. 

The app should focus on the busy user, as such, the simplicity must be there, so the user can easily understand and manage their accounts. Instead of taking great deals of time to understand. Each process that a user wants to do should be as fast as possible. There should not be any point in which the user has fields that are required aside from a name and a date. The user should be able to create something and be reminded that important fields are empty, but are not necessarily wrong. 

Objectives (in a chronological order):

1. To obtain information about the client to address the client in a non-formal way, to present as a user-friendly application. 

2. Set recurring habits at a planned time each day. 

3. Inside this app, there must be money functionality as well, that will be built upon in future updates. 

4.
